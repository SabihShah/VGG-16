# VGG-16

Keras implementation of VGG-16 model

## Dataset
- The blood cells dataset is used for this project. It can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unclesamulus/blood-cells-image-dataset.
- The dataset contains 17,092 images of individual normal cells, acquired using the analyzer CellaVision DM96 in the Core Laboratory at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
- The dataset is organized in the following eight groups: neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, immature granulocytes (promyelocytes, myelocytes, and metamyelocytes), erythroblasts and platelets or thrombocytes.
- The size of the images is 360 x 363 pixels, in format JPG, and expert clinical pathologists annotated them. The images were captured from individuals without infection, hematologic or oncologic disease and free of any pharmacologic treatment at the moment of blood collection.
- The distribution of data among labels is shown below
